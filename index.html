				I've seen a beautiful heading-numbering system a while ago
				<a href="https://essays.uxdesign.cc/tech-diet/">on the Internet</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				It was a clever, sharp numbering system – very clear, very pretty – but
				it was built using a god-awful, Frankenstein-esque JS-augmented CSS
				system that defied explanation.
				<a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/19266/wtfsm/">WTFs/min</a>
				were high. Confusion ensued.

			<p>
				This is an experiment to produce the same result via custom CSS,
				constructed specifically for this page.

			<p class="postscriptum">
				If you don't see what's so special about it, you might be viewing this
				on a screen that's a bit too small. This experiment shines on screen
				sizes of ~700px and up. (In my defense, so does the original.)

						Nippon Veterinary and Life Science University, NVLU in short, is
						a private university in Musashino, Tokyo, Japan. The predecessor
						of the school was founded 1881, and it was chartered as a

						Harold Levinson is an American psychiatrist and author, known
						for developing his cerebellar theory of treating dyslexia.
						Levinson has pursued alternative theories and treatments for
						dyslexia since the 1960s. In 1973 he and Jan Frank published an
						article in the Journal of Child Psychiatry suggesting dyslexia
						was caused by a faulty connection between the cerebellum and the
						other parts of the brain, instead of the cerebrum.
					</p>
					<p>
						By 1974 Levinson's cerebellar and related inner-ear theory that
						dyslexia has been mentioned in the popular press. His
						cerebellar-vestibular theory led him to treating children with
						dyslexia as he children with an inner ear problem, using
						anti-motion sickness medication. He used the same
						over-the-counter medication to treat theassociated attention
						deficit, hyperactivity, impaired concentration and
						distractibility.
					</p>
					<p>
						Levinson appeared on television to discuss his treatment in the
						late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1985, he observed that 750 out of
						1000 dyslexia patients also had problems with balance and
						coordination. By 1986 Levinson had treated more than 8,000
						patients with dyslexia, and reported a success rate of between
						75% and 80%. He had also studied more than 20,000 patients in
						total.
					</p>
					<p>
						Levinson was interviewed on The Phil Donahue Show in the early
						1980s, in addition to many other network shows like Lifestyles
						with Regis Philbin, and The Today Show, The Morning Show.
						Levinson used to be a clinical associate professor of psychiatry
						at New York University Medical Center. Levinson became the
						director of the Medical Dyslexic and Attention Deficit Disorder
						Treatment Centre on Long Island.

						The M17 motorway is an inter-urban motorway in Ireland, forming
						part of the Sligo to Galway national primary road. The motorway
						runs between the Kilmore Roundabout in Tuam and Junction 18 on
						the M6 motorway. There is one Junction (19) which is an exit for
						Roscommon and Baile Chláir. A number of upgrade projects were
						planned for the N17, which forms part of the Atlantic Corridor
						under Transport 21, along with the N18 and N20.
					</p>
					<p>
						In April 2014, this project was given the go-ahead by the
						Government and was opened to the public by Minister Shane Ross
						on the 27th of September 2017, many months ahead of schedule.
						The motorway is not tolled. Pokrovska is a station on Dnipro
						Metro's Tsentralno–Zavodska Line. It is a sub-surface station,
						accessible by stairs and was opened on December 29, 1995 along
						with the rest of the system's first stations.
					</p>
					<p>
						The station is located on the corner of the Yuria Kondratuka
						Street and the Velyka Diivska Street and in the Chervonyi Kamin
						and Pokrovsky (former Komunar) residential areas of Dnipro.
						Until 24 November 2015 the station was named Komunarivska for
						the former name of Yuria Kondratuka Street - Komunarivska.
						Kalgan in a small town in the Great Southern region of Western
						Australia.
					</p>
					<p>
						The town is situated on the banks of the Kalgan River and was
						first known as Kalganup which means "place of first camp" or
						"place of many waters". Indigenous Australians used the area as
						a meeting place up to 19,000 years ago. The name was first
						recorded in 1831 when explorer Alexander Collie charted the
						area. Land was set aside for a townsite in 1837 and was sparsely
						settled, with approximately a dozen people living in the area in
						1900.
					</p>
					<p>
						The town was gazetted in 1912 following land being opened up in
						the area. The Upper Kalgan Hall was constructed in 1912 and
						became a focal point for the community. By 1913 the population
						was approximately 150 people. The Lower Kalgan Hall was
						constructed in 1954. Both the lower and Upper Halls are on the
						Heritage Council of Western Australia listed places. An
						independent school, Great Southern Grammar, was built along
						Oyster Harbour near where the Kalgan River discharges into the
						harbour.

						Imphal Talkies and the Howlers is a folk-rock band from Manipur,
						India. The band released its debut album Tiddim Road in 2009,
						and has since then performed across India and released some
						prominent albums. The band is known for singing protest songs
						about politics, insurgency, human rights issues, and racial
						attacks in Manipur and across the North-East States of India.
						Their music has also been associated as working against the
						draconian act AFSPA of 1958, that grant special powers to the
						Indian Armed Forces in some states of India, which are branded
						as "disturbed areas" by the Indian Government.
					</p>
					<p>
						The band was formed by Akhu Chingangbam (vocal and guitar) with
						Sachidananda Angom (guitar) in 2008. Other band members include
						Irom Singthoi (percussion), Chaoba Thiyam (pena),and Karnajit
						Laishram (bass). Imphal Talkies and the Howlers derive their
						name from the name of a cinema theatre 'Imphal Talkies', in
						front of Kangla Fort. The cinema theatre used to screen only ‘A’
						rated movies in a conservative Manipur society ahead of time. In
						June 2016, it was reported that the band’s vocalist Akhu
						Chingangbam was involved in a major road accident and was kept
						in the ICU for some time.

						Hyarotis microstictum, the brush flitter, is a butterfly
						belonging to the family Hesperiidae. It is found in the
						Indomalayan realm (Assam to Myanmar, Thailand, Langkawi, Malaya,
						Borneo, Sumatra, Philippines) and in South India. H. m. coorga
						Evans, 1949 is the subspecies found in South India. H. m.

						Male. Upperside, both wings dark vandyke-brown, suffused with
						purple especially on the costal and outer margins and the veins;
						the cilia ochreous-grey. Forewing with five small
						semi-transparent white lustrous spots, two (the first of which
						is very minute) before the apex, and three discal, one geminated
						in the cell consisting of an anterior outwardly convex thin
						crescentic and a posterior triangular portion, another about the
						same size behind and a little external to this between the first
						and second median nervules sub-crescentic in shape, with its
						convexity turned towards the base, and a third squarish external
						to and in front of, and rather less than half the size of, this
						again between the second and turned median nervules.

						A mansard or mansard roof (also called a French roof or curb
						roof) is a four-sided gambrel-style hip roof characterized by
						two slopes on each of its sides with the lower slope, punctured
						by dormer windows, at a steeper angle than the upper. The steep
						roof with windows creates an additional floor of habitable space
						(a garret), and reduces the overall height of the roof for a
						given number of habitable stories.
					</p>
					<p>
						The earliest known example of a mansard roof is credited to
						Pierre Lescot on part of the Louvre built around 1550. This roof
						design was popularized in the early 17th century by François
						Mansart (1598–1666), an accomplished architect of the French
						Baroque period. It became especially fashionable during the
						Second French Empire (1852–1870) of Napoleon III.
					</p>
					<p>
						Two distinct traits of the mansard roof – steep sides and a
						double pitch – sometimes lead to it being confused with other
						roof types. Since the upper slope of a mansard roof is rarely
						visible from the ground, a conventional single-plane roof with
						steep sides may be misidentified as a mansard roof. The gambrel
						roof style, commonly seen in barns in North America, is a close
						cousin of the mansard.

						John 'Jock' Napier Malloch was an English footballer who played
						as an outside left for Dundee, Sheffield Wednesday, Barnsley and
						South Kirkby. Malloch left Dundee for Sheffield Wednesday in
						1900 for a fee of £50. In April 1900 Malloch and fellow Dundee
						player, Low, had been playing together in England and joined
						Sheffield Wednesday on trial, with their prospective club,
						Brighton United in financial difficulties.
					</p>
					<p>
						Following the benefit match at the end of the 1907/08 season
						Malloch found his time at Wednesday confined to the reserves and
						on New Year's Eve 1908 he transferred to local rivals Barnsley.
						His time at Barnsley began with a series of poor performances
						and by September he had moved on to South Kirkby.
					</p>
					<p>
						At South Kirkby Malloch once again found form and was
						instrumental in helping the club to the semi-final of the
						Sheffield Challenge Cup and the final of the Wharncliffe Charity
						Cup in the 1911/12 season. The final of the Wharncliffe Cup saw
						Malloch return to familiar territory at Owlerton Stadium, where
						South Kirkby met his old rivals Sheffield United.
